One day I looked at my old project, [ray][].
This is a very simple raytracer written in C++.
At first the performance of the code was my biggest concern so I resolved
some bottlenecks there. After the program seemed to be fast enough I
decided to reduce its size.

This blog details my results and the way I achieved them.
