My name is Laszlo, I am a software developer and one day I looked at one
of my old projects, [ray][]. This is a very simple raytracer written in C++.
At first
the slowness of the code was my biggest concern so I resolved some
bottlenecks. After the program seemed fast enough I decided to reduce the
size.

This blog details my results and the way I achieved them.
