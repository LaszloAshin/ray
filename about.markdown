As a software developer and one day I looked at one of my old projects,
[ray][]. This is a very simple raytracer written in C++.
At first
the performance of the code was my biggest concern so I resolved some
bottlenecks. After the program seemed to be fast enough I decided to
reduce the size.

This blog details my results and the way I achieved them.
